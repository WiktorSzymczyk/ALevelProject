##This project is my end of year A Level Computer Science project. I got told to create a solution to a problem chosen by myself. At the beginning it was difficult
##to come up with any a problem that requires a solution as I wanted to create something outside the box.
###Please see attatched file to view my entire project overview as well as Analysis, Design, Development, Testing and Evaluation.
